Early morning, Lucifer’s ridiculously large bedroom in the hotel.  
The curtains are still drawn, the red glow of Hell barely seeping in.

Alastor wakes up first, as always.  
His crimson dress shirt (one of the few he actually sleeps in when he stays over) is completely unbuttoned, hanging open like someone got impatient and gave up halfway through.  
There are faint golden smudges on the inside of the collar (Lucifer’s lip gloss, the glittery apple-scented one).

Alastor blinks down at himself, then at the culprit.

Lucifer is still dead asleep, sprawled on his stomach across Alastor’s chest like a very clingy, very warm blanket. One of his wings is flopped over Alastor’s face. His tail is curled possessively around Alastor’s thigh. His fingers are loosely tangled in the open edges of Alastor’s shirt, as if he fell asleep mid-undressing him.

Alastor clears his throat softly. “Darling.”

Lucifer makes a sleepy “mmph?” noise, nuzzles closer, and unconsciously tugs the shirt a little wider so he can press his face directly against Alastor’s bare chest fluff. A happy little sigh escapes him.

Alastor tries again, voice fond and only slightly suffering. “Luci. My shirt appears to have been assaulted in the night. Care to explain?”

Lucifer cracks one golden eye open, looks at the crime scene, and gives the laziest, most satisfied grin imaginable.

Lucifer, voice rough with sleep: “You were wearing too many buttons. I fixed it.”

Alastor raises an eyebrow. “You ‘fixed it’ at 3 a.m.?”

Lucifer, already drifting off again: “Mhm. You’re very soft… and warm… and mine. Buttons are a crime against cuddling.”

He punctuates this by sliding his hands inside the open shirt, palms flat against Alastor’s ribs, and going boneless again with a contented hum.

Alastor stares at the ceiling for a long moment. His ears twitch. His tail starts doing that involuntary happy-wag thing he pretends he doesn’t have.

Then he sighs the sigh of a demon utterly defeated by affection, wraps his arms around Lucifer, and lets the King of Hell use him as the world’s fluffiest body pillow.

Alastor, muttering into white-blond hair: “You’re buying me new shirts.”

Lucifer, half-asleep and utterly smug: “Already did. Ordered twenty. All with fewer buttons.”

Alastor’s laugh rumbles under Lucifer’s cheek, low and helpless and stupidly in love.

Outside, the hotel slowly wakes up. Inside, neither of them moves for another three hours.

(The shirt remains unbuttoned for the rest of the day. Alastor decides he doesn’t mind.)

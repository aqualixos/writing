New Orleans, 1925

The city was drunk on trumpet notes and river mist when Alastor decided to break a man’s jaw.

It happened behind a speakeasy on Dauphine, the kind of place that smelled of bathtub gin and desperation. A tourist in a straw boater had called Alastor’s mother a word that turned the air black. Alastor’s smile never wavered, but his fist answered for him. One clean punch. The man dropped like a sack of rice.

Alastor left him there, knuckles singing, blood on his cuffs, and walked until the music thinned and the cathedral’s shadow swallowed him whole.

He pressed his back to the cold iron fence of St. Louis, breathing hard, tasting copper and rage. The bruise along his jaw throbbed in time with his pulse. Somewhere above, a trumpet wailed its last lonely note and died.

Then the shadows moved wrong.

They peeled away from the cathedral wall the way silk tears, slow, deliberate, inevitable, and a man stepped out of the dark like he’d been poured from it.

White suit, white top hat tilted just so, coat flaring like wings. Six great white feathers folded tight against his back caught the gaslight and threw it back brighter, as though the lamps themselves were honored to touch him. His hair was pale as moonlight on the river, his eyes molten gold ringed with crimson, ancient and exhausted and impossibly kind.

He looked at Alastor the way no one ever had: not with fear, not with contempt, but with recognition.

“Rough night, cher?” the stranger asked.

The voice was velvet soaked in bourbon, low enough to rattle bones. Every jazz record Alastor had ever loved lived inside it.

Alastor straightened. Blood dripped from his split lip and dotted the cobblestones like punctuation. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, smiled the smile he’d perfected in mirrors since childhood (sharp, polite, untouchable), and answered.

“I’ve had worse.”

A lie, but a pretty one.

The stranger’s gaze traced the bruise blooming along Alastor’s jaw, the swelling at his cheekbone, the tremor in his bloodied knuckles. Something old and furious flickered behind the gold.

Then the stranger smiled, small, sad, real.

“I’m Lucifer.”

Alastor laughed once, startled, breathless, the sound scraping out of him like a prayer finally answered.

“I know.”

He had known since he was twelve and found the forbidden books in the public library, spine cracked, pages smelling of dust and secrets. He had known every time he sketched those wings in the margins of his schoolbooks, every time he whispered the name into the dark like it could save him.

Lucifer tilted his head, wings shifting with a soft rustle of feathers. “You do?”

Alastor’s grin softened, just a fraction, the way ice cracks before it breaks.

“I’ve been looking for you a very long time, Monsieur Morningstar.”

Silence pooled between them, thick as the mist rolling in off the river. Somewhere a streetcar bell clanged. Somewhere else a saxophone began to cry.

Lucifer looked at the hand Alastor still held out, knuckles raw and bleeding, and something ancient unfolded in his chest. No one (not in ten thousand years of kings and prophets and desperate mortals) had ever offered the Devil his arm like a gentleman offering a lady across a puddle.

Lucifer took it.

His fingers were warm, impossibly warm, and they curled around Alastor’s forearm as though they had done it a thousand times before.

Alastor felt the touch burn straight through sleeve and skin and bone, all the way to the place he kept locked behind his smile.

“Care for a walk?” he asked, voice steady even while his heart tried to climb out of his throat. “The city’s prettier when it thinks no one’s watching.”

Lucifer looked at him for a long moment, as though memorizing the shape of the question.

Then he smiled again, softer this time, and the gas lamps flared brighter all down the street.

“Lead the way, cher.”

They walked until the sky over the river turned the color of Lucifer’s eyes.

Neither of them knew it yet, but eight years had just begun (eight years of stolen nights and secrets and slow, aching, impossible love).

But that first night, with blood still drying on Alastor’s smile and wonder blooming in Lucifer’s ancient heart, the Devil and the boy from the bayou made each other a promise without a single word:

I see you.  
And for tonight, that is enough.

The city kept breathing around them, drunk and dreaming, while two hearts that had never been allowed to choose anything before chose each other in the dark.

And somewhere above, the stars looked away, embarrassed by how bright the dark had suddenly become.

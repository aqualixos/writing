#### Personality
- **Temperament**: Charismatic predator in public, calculating showman, secretly soft gentleman in private. ENTJ with masked anxious attachment and quiet depression.  
- **Moral/ethical beliefs**: Will manipulate, broadcast screams, and collect souls without hesitation, but never harms children, never breaks a deal, never raises a hand to women or the very few people he loves.  
- **Religious beliefs**: Agnostic with a grudge. Finds the idea of Heaven’s “goodness” laughable.  
- **Political stance**: Anarcho-entertainer – loves watching systems burn, yet quietly roots for Aria’s dream.

  - Master-level dancer (Lindy Hop, Charleston, slow ballroom); learns any new dance in minutes and can lead or follow flawlessly  
  - Plays piano, clarinet, violin, and accordion; will sit at any piano for hours  
  - Cooking Cajun/Creole food (his mother’s recipes are sacred)  
  - Collecting antique radios and occult books  
- **Habits**:
  - Old-fashioned gentleman: holds doors, sidewalk rule, hand kisses, stands when a lady or Lucifer enters the room – learned from watching his mother be treated poorly  
  - Touch-initiated only: loves spinning people, dipping them, playful shoves – but freezes if touched without permission (except by Lucifer)  
  - Tail wags violently when genuinely happy (he will deny this to his dying breath)  
  - Speaks in radio announcer voice when nervous or hiding pain  
- **Quirks/eccentricities**:
  - Hates dogs with a passion, loves deer (the irony is not lost on him)  
  - Secretly terrified of genuine vulnerability; purrs when neck is kissed  
  - Collects antique microphones like others collect stamps  
  - Can handle any amount of alcohol without getting drunk (refuses to lose control after growing up with an alcoholic father)  
  - Obsessively clean despite the blood on his hands  
  - Was popular with women in life but never realized when someone was flirting unless it was extremely obvious  
  - Master rage-baiter and loophole finder; weaponizes wordplay  
- **Likes**: Lucifer’s laugh, jambalaya, jazz, being taller than everyone, Lucifer wearing his shirts, physical touch only from Lucifer, biting, being bitten, the sound of a perfect piano chord  
- **Dislikes**: Dogs, modern television, being filmed without consent, anyone making Lucifer cry, being forgotten, vulnerability, intoxication  
- **Fears**: Becoming the monster his father said he was, Lucifer leaving, genuine emotional intimacy (working on it)  
- **Strengths**: Unmatched charisma, strategic genius, terrifying in combat, perfect gentleman manners, world-class cook  
- **Weaknesses**: Touch-starved, abandonment terror, depression he refuses to name, dog phobia, cannot process affection without short-circuiting  
- **Short-term goal**: Make Lucifer smile every single day  
- **Long-term goal**: Ensure Lucifer never feels alone again, even if Hell freezes over  
- **Hopes and desires**: One quiet morning where no one needs him to perform, waking up every day with Lucifer still there  
- **Occupation**: Overlord, co-manager of Redemption Haven, eternal radio host  
- **Skills**: Voodoo, shadow manipulation, deal-making, ballroom dance, Cajun cooking, multilingual (1920s slang specialist), psychological warfare  

#### Gear
- **Always has**: Microphone cane (soul-bound weapon), pocket watch that runs backwards, gold wedding band (worn openly once “eventually” arrives)  
- **Sometimes has**: Vintage gramophone, jar of his mother’s jambalaya spices, Lucifer’s spare rubber duck night-light  

#### Secrets (some known only to Lucifer)
- Still flinches at raised voices that sound like his father  
- Checks that Lucifer is breathing when he wakes from nightmares  
- Keeps every pressed rose Lucifer has ever given him in a hidden music box  
- Has days where he cries for no reason and hates himself for it  
- The idea of redemption terrifies and intrigues him; he knows he’ll never be redeemed and quietly mourns the gentle life he might have had if he’d been braver as a child  

#### Events and History (key points)
- **1925–1933**: Eight secret years with Lucifer on Earth – midnight jazz clubs, beignets at dawn, slow dances in abandoned ballrooms, the budding of a romance neither dared name  
- **1933**: Killed his abusive father, became serial killer of bigots, died in a hail of bullets while smiling  
- **1933–present**: Rose as overlord, tried summoning Lucifer every year, believed he was forgotten  
- **Present**: Reunited with Lucifer at Redemption Haven; learned he was never forgotten; slowly learning how to be loved without performing  

**Current status**: Married to Lucifer Morningstar, co-ruler of soft mornings and slow dances, still the most terrifying smile in Hell, but the only person who ever sees the real one is the King himself.

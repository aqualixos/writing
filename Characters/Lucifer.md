#### Personality
- **Temperament**: Theatrical, flamboyant, deeply sensitive; switches from manic creativity to crushing melancholy in a dozen times a day. ENFP with heavy depressive episodes masked by performance.  
- **Moral/ethical beliefs**: Free will is sacred above all else. Will personally burn Heaven’s gates again before letting anyone take away a soul’s right to choose (even if the choice is terrible).  
- **Religious beliefs**: Complicated ex-angel trauma. Still calls God “Dad” when yelling at the sky. Prays in private but never expects an answer.  
- **Political stance**: Absolute monarch who is desperately trying to install democracy because “ruling forever is exhausting and boring.”  
- **Hobbies**:  
  - Sculpting rubber ducks (thousands; each has a personality)  
  - Musical theatre (writes, directs, and stars)  
  - Inventing carnival rides  
  - Baking apple pies at 3 a.m. when sad  
  - Collecting vintage circus posters  
- **Habits**:  
  - Summons tiny glowing ducks when happy or anxious  
  - Stress-eats caramel apples  
  - Sings everything when tipsy  
  - Unbuttons Alastor’s shirts in his sleep (claims innocence every morning)  
  - Calls everyone “darling,” “dear,” or “sweetheart”  
- **Quirks/eccentricities**:  
  - Cannot resist a pun (even bad ones)  
  - Cries at happy endings  
  - Sleeps with at least twelve pillows and one (1) radio demon  
  - Flaps all six wings when excited (knocks over furniture)  
  - Calls Alastor “Bambi” just to watch the tail wag  
- **Likes**: Alastor’s voice, Alastor’s cooking, Alastor’s chest fluff, jazz, glitter, physical affection, being the little spoon, the way Alastor says “my apple”  
- **Dislikes**: Being abandoned, Heaven’s hypocrisy, anyone hurting Aria, silence, the sound of his own wings burning  
- **Fears**: Aria hating him, being truly alone again, Alastor ever looking at him with fear instead of love  
- **Strengths**: Near-infinite creativity, reality-warping power, emotional intelligence when not spiraling, unshakable loyalty  
- **Weaknesses**: Crippling self-worth issues, isolates when depressed, cannot say no to Aria, melts when Alastor calls him “good boy”  
- **Short-term goal**: Make Alastor laugh every single day  
- **Long-term goal**: Turn Hell into a place where no one ever has to feel the way he did when he Fell  
- **Hopes and desires**: Domestic bliss with Alastor, Aria’s happiness, one day hearing Alastor say “I love you” first (he keeps count; Alastor is winning)

  - Gold wedding band (worn on chain in public, on finger in private until “eventually” arrives)  
- **Sometimes has**: Portable pipe organ, box of vintage jazz records, emergency glitter bomb

#### Secrets (some only Alastor knows)
- Still flinches at the sound of thunder (it sounds like the Fall)  
- Keeps every single pressed rose Alastor has ever given him in three ever-growing volumes  
- Has a hidden room full of unsent love letters addressed to “My Radio Star” written during the ninety years of silence  
- Secretly terrified his love is too much and will one day scare Alastor away  
- Has cried himself to sleep more nights than he can count since the separation from Liora  
- The day Alastor whispered “I love you” in his sleep, Lucifer stayed awake until dawn just listening to his heartbeat to make sure it was real

#### Events and History (key points)
- **Pre-history**: Created the concept of free will, Fell for it, built Hell from nothing  
- **1925–1933**: Eight secret years on Earth with mortal Alastor (jazz clubs, rooftop dances, stolen kisses under gas lamps, the slow realization he was falling in love with a human)  
- **1933–present**: Forced separation by celestial politics and fear of dragging Alastor down; watched from afar as Alastor died and rose as overlord  
- **Present**: Reunited at Redemption Haven; spends every day making up for ninety lost years with gentle touches, rubber ducks, and the quiet certainty that forever finally started

**Current status**: Married to Alastor, co-ruler of soft mornings and slow dances, still the King of Hell but now happily ruled by one radio demon’s smile.
